# Progress

## What's Working
- The basic Vue.js project structure is set up and appears to be functional.
- A set of UI components (`Header`, `Footer`, `Hero`, etc.) has been created, indicating that the foundational UI elements are in place.
- The project is configured with Vite for development and building.

## What Still Needs to be Built
- Further development may include adding more complex business logic, interactivity, and potentially integrating with backend APIs.
- Documentation for specific components and logic is likely needed.

## Progress Status
The layout and typography have been optimized for better readability and responsiveness. The core UI is now more polished. The project is ready for the next phase of feature implementation or content addition.
