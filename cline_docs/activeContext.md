# Active Context

## What Is Being Worked On
The project was updated to include a new login page and to have all its content localized to Chinese.

## Recent Changes
- **Vue Router**: Installed and configured `vue-router` to enable multi-page navigation.
- **Routing Structure**:
  - Created a new `src/router/index.js` file to define routes for the home and login pages.
  - Created a new `src/views/HomeView.vue` to encapsulate the main page content (Hero, Features).
  - Created a new `src/views/LoginView.vue` and designed a modern, stylized login form.
- **App Structure**: Modified `App.vue` to use `<router-view>` for displaying routed components.
- **Chinese Localization**:
  - Updated `Header.vue`, `Hero.vue`, `Features.vue`, and `Footer.vue` with Chinese text.
  - Updated all relevant `<router-link>` and `<a>` tags to point to the correct routes (`/` and `/login`).
- **Main Entry Point**: Updated `src/main.js` to initialize and use the new router instance.

## Next Steps
- The new login page and Chinese localization are complete.
- The project is ready for review. Awaiting further instructions.
